 Hi, I’m Dan. I use this Github account to showcase the set of skills I've built in my time as a data scientist. 
 
 I've created solutions for projects from ad-hoc SQL queries to supervised machine learning tools in production. 

My experience with programming spans nine years and multiple programming languages, although R is my first love.

Please reach out with any questions or feel free to offer suggestions on anything you see.
